# Tech Stack:
- React.js (Functional Components w/ hooks)
- Styled Components
- React Spring (used for micro animations)
- Styled Reset (used to reset browser styles)
- Netlify

## Why I choose this tech stack ...

### React
I choose react because it allows me to break up my code into components and use them throughout the app. I love using hooks and creating awesome UI's.

### Styled Components
A first I didn't like styled components, but messing around with the library in my side projects I realized the power behind it. Styled components also allows me to re-use css inside components, instead of repeating css. (other options were CSS modules and Sass)

### React Spring
I've only use thing library a hand full of times but It allows me to create nice animations without writing them from scratch. Saved me alot of time in this project. 

### Styled Reset
This library is just one of many CSS reset libraries. Since I'm using styled components, it only made sense to use it.

## Buttons and Links
I thought it would be cool if all the buttons and links worked. so most of the URL's in the links and buttons work and are from the saleswhale website. (execpt the top nav, Which I choose to use a micro animation on click)

## Mobile Nav
I choose to create a mobile drop down navbar even though it was not in the figma.


# To saleswhale ... 
I put alot of time an energy in this project to make it match the designs in the figma. I had so much fun and I look forward to the next steps of the interview!
