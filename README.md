# Tech Stack:
- React.js (With React hooks)
- Styled Components
- React Spring (used for micro animations)
- Styled Reset (used to reset browser styles)
- Vercel (Frontend Deployment)

## Why I choose this tech stack

### React
I choose react because it allows me to break up my code into components and use them throughout the app. I love using hooks and creating awesome UI's.

### Styled Components
A first I didn't like styled components, but messing around with the library in my side projects I realized the power behind it. Styled components also allows me to re-use css inside components, instead of repeating css. (other options were CSS modules and Sass)

### React Spring
I've only used this library a hand full of times but It allows me to create nice animations without writing them from scratch. It saved me alot of time in this project. 

### Styled Reset
This library is just one of many CSS reset libraries. Since I'm using styled components, it only made sense to use it.
